# User-Space Application for BMP280 I2C Temperature Sensor

## Overview
This C program reads temperature data from the `/dev/i2c_temp` device file, which is created by the BMP280 I2C temperature sensor driver. It opens the device file, reads the temperature value, and displays it on the console.

## Features
- Opens the character device `/dev/i2c_temp`
- Reads temperature data from the sensor
- Displays temperature in degrees Celsius
